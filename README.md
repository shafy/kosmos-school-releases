# Science Simulations by Kosmos School

Our simulations are NGSS aligned, and work great for teachers and students, either in the classroom or at home.

Kosmos School's simulations are a great learning resource, because they are interactive, engaging and effective (especially for understanding abstract concepts).


### Highlights

* Run experiments and simulations to teach and learn science
* Automatically generates data and charts for analysis
* NGSS aligned, perfect for your classroom or at home


We're adding new simulations continuously, here's the current list:

### Physics
* Gravity and Air Resistance (available, free)
* Conservation of Energy (available, free)
* Magnetic Fields (coming soon)
* Newton's Laws of Motion (coming soon)
* Newton's Law of Gravitation (coming soon)
* Centripetal Force (coming soon)
* Work and Energy (coming soon)
* And many more

While we focus on physics initially, chemistry and biology topics are also coming soon.

Let us know which topics you'd like to have and we'll make sure to prioritize them: hello@kosmosschool.com
